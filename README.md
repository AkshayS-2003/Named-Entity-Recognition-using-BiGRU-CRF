# Named-Entity-Recognition-using-BiGRU-CRF
The Named Entity Recognition task uses a BiGRU + CRF model with GloVe and BERT embeddings, where GloVe provides static word representations and BERT adds contextual embeddings. This combination captures sequential dependencies and ensures accurate, consistent entity predictions.
